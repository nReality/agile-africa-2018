As the lead for Agile transformation in one of the largest banks in Africa I am severely aware of this mammoth transformation endeavor that lies ahead of a number of my Agile comrades.</p><br><p>If you are in a position to teach, coach or influence the agile transformation of your enterprise organisation, whether in a leadership position or a change agent, and are concerned about the embedded sustainability of your agile transformation, then this presentation will appeal to you.</p><br><p>Our immediate inclination in an Agile transformation is to just get started by educating, restructuring and creating product/Scrum teams – in an enterprise this can be effective however is not sustainable. We need enterprises to transcend their view of Agile as just a set of values and principles in the service of software delivery and instead consider it as an eco-system that must be balanced and maintained. In this presentation I will describe the eco-system that supports sustainable enterprise Agile transformation (SEAT) and delve into how they must be influenced to develop a transformation program. There must be a people centric mindset at the core of what they do, so that it supports the organisation’s agile culture transformation.</p><br><p>I will delve into the importance of human resources as a lynch pin to Agile transformation, look at how project and change departments must fundamentally change their view on their existence in the new way of working as well as how marketing must be driven by product and not the other way around. We will unpack the transformation required by finance to be less focused on profit and loss and more on value for money. I will highlight the importance of how business and technology risk must re-evaluate the measures of risk to the business from a financial, operational, compliance and reputational perspective. We will also lift the lid on how audit and legal need to relinquish a significant level of control on the premise of delivering customer value.</p><br><p>The presentation concludes with the bringing together of all the parts of the eco-system through authentic leadership and how easily management can derail your transformation.</p><br><p></p>",

In particular, how do you get managers at all levels to shift out of the old waterfall way of thinking and behaving and really adopt Agile ? How do you get feature teams to be autonomous and self-managing ?\nWe know we need to address the behaviour and cultures that are thwarting Agility, but are stuck on the ‘how ? ’ As organisations and coaches, it is easy to coach only at a process level in the hope that by focusing people on ‘doing’ Agile they will start to ‘think’ Agile. In so doing, we often actively avoid focusing on the people and how they are engaging with Agile, believing that this is a specialized field outside of our scope and limited to people like therapists & professional coaches. This often results in a high demand and dependence on Agile coaches to ensure people stick to the processes and principles.\nAt its core, Agile is a shift away from unilateral control. Only unilateral control is a way of being that is deeply embedded within us (leaders and followers alike) and so hard to shift without a conscious intervention.\nWithin Standard Bank we have been implementing a Behaviour Laboratory run internally by IT resources that focuses on a new style of leadership – the mutual learning model. Introduced by Roger Schwartz in his book “The Skilled Facilitator”, mutual learning and its ground rules for collaboration create strong support for Agile and SAFE implementation at an individual level and in so doing, allows us to create and actively support an environment and behaviours that sustain the agile culture shift.</p><br><p></p>",

I also knew that, shortly, he would be walking into his customer’s office in this new role.</p><br><p>Agile Coach is the new black! But how can you, a good coach, stand out from the crowd of less competent peers? Let me offer you this workshop to explore the science of coaching and the ways in which it works. We start with concepts of neuroplasticity and the brain processes of creating new neuron pathways. Then we move to motivation and learn which type is the best. Finally, we finish with the discussion on brain activation states which we practice in a few short exercises. By understanding the new field of coaching psychology, you will become a better practitioner.</p><br><p>I am an affiliate member of the Institute of Coaching at McLean Hospital, the Harvard Medical School affiliate.

The challenges can be summarised as follows:\n• Lack of business engagement – most Agile adoptions are driven by the IT organisation and leave business and operations behind\n• Program execution – at a team level, Agile works well, however, when large programmes of execution are required, how do we manage the delivery\n• Team delivery – Ensuring that the team delivering the value is provided with the necessary constraints, conditions and purpose\n• Lack of systems thinking – extending agility to all the supporting functions in the organisation (e.g.) Finance, Procurement, Facilities, Human resources etc\n• Lack of people Change management – the biggest challenge typically is that Agile adoptions are mandated from executives to deliver the promise of Agile, however, leaders underestimate the impact that it has on the people</p><br><p>As a result of these assumptions, we conducted the first Agile Index South Africa which was to validate these observations through a quantitative survey as well as interviews with key leaders in these organisations based on their experiences.</p><br><p>The talk is aimed leaders and individuals that are currently on or starting an Agile adoption by discussing each of these challenges identified and validated (or NOT) through the research as well as providing some options in addressing these challenges.</p><br><p>Note: the research is ongoing at present and therefore, the challenges identified above may change</p><br><p></p>",

In meetings, training and conferences I have always used this as a way to concentrate and understand certain topics. Over the years this doodling has evolved into more of a visual note-taking technique, or sketchnoting. I love that this form of note-taking activates the four modes of learning: audio, read-write, visual and kinaesthetic / movement. Thus people reading them will hopefully remember the presentations more vividly, and those who missed it have access to some of the ideas. The skill of visual thinking has helped me add value as a Scrum Master, which is my profession in the Agility team at IQ Business, and whenever I get a chance I am a Sketchnoter…</p><br><p></p>",

After all, that is where the saying “a picture is worth a thousand words” comes from. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that expressing yourself visually (as well as verbally) improves the likelihood that others will not only understand what you are trying to say but also retain the message. A picture has a way of showing ideas and solutions that would have remained hidden if you hadn’t picked up a pen. But a good picture doesn’t eliminate the need for words. It just reduces the number of words we use, so that the ones left behind are the most important…</p><br><p>So why is thinking visually so important?</p><br><p>When working in complex environments and trying to influence change in the workplace, it is essential that we are equipped with the knowledge and tools to tap into different styles of learning. Recent studies show that 65% of people learn and retain information more effectively by seeing words, as well as images. In contrast, only 30% of people learn through verbal communication alone. So if you aren’t one of the 65% of visual learners, someone in your team probably is!</p><br><p>Luckily, you don’t need to be an artist to think visually! Join us as we co-create a visual vocabulary you can practically apply at work or in your personal capacity (during studying and learning). We will take you through the elements essential for visual thinking, as well as some ideas for visualizing concepts. No PowerPoint slides allowed!</p><br><p>This session is for anyone who needs to innovate, invent, analyze, come up with solutions, ideate, solve problems, retain information and build up their confidence to pick up a pen.</p><br><p></p>",

Edwards Deming says: “Management’s job is to optimize the whole system”\nThe presentation will use a ‘phantom’ traffic jam and the traffic jam nature in order to help us better understand the behavior of organizational bottlenecks and why the “opposite way” of slowing down will help organizations improve performance and become much faster.\nAgile implementation and the related change process established new kinds of organization bottlenecks mainly in the product discovery (backlog preparation) and the testing efforts, both require solutions by managers.\nUsing the “shift Left” approach, implementing practices like ATDD will help agile teams and managers to improve both of the above bottlenecks.\nThe presentation will discuss practices that will help managers to analyze bottlenecks in the project and the right ways to handle them.\nAwareness and understanding of the management paradigm will help them take the “Red Pill” and adopt the concept of “Slowing Down in order to get faster”.</p><br><p></p>",

Therefore, I used to attend Agile conferences across the globe (Agile Prague, Agile Singapore, Agile Israel) and joint workshops (Value Stream workshops in Toyota Japan) as an attendee as well as a lecturer.</p><br><p></p>",
