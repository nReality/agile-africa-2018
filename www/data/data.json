Join us in this workshop where we will use complexity tools and practices to unpack your sticky issues so that you can start to make sense of them and find ways to make changes. We spend time getting a few sticky issues from the audience.  Once we have these to work with, we apply tools from complexity thinking to unpack what's going on, look for patterns, come up with solutions and share with each other. You will learn new tools, collaborate with others on their sticky issues and understand what and what your next wise action could be.<p><br></p>Who is this for: Intermediate to advanced practitioners  </p><br><p></p>",

While still being very involved technically, his first focus is on facilitating a safe, creative, collaborative environment.<p><br></p>John hosts and produces the well-respected Agile Path podcast where he creates in-depth audio documentaries on the topics that most affect organisations transitioning to agile ways of working and other critical issues. The first season focuses on the effect of psychological safety (or the lack there of) on organisations and wider society. This has led to many speaking engagements across the UK, US and Europe.<p><br></p>John’s approach is focused on helping organisations create an environment that fosters creative collaboration. He is known for his infectious passion and sense of humour that brings in a much-needed injection of energy to unmotivated, challenged teams.</p><br><p></p>",

In these industries, I have been responsible for building and leading teams in the delivery and support of customer value primarily using Agile frameworks.<p><br></p>I have discovered through this journey that true agility has nothing to with frameworks and processes. True agility is about people, and more importantly, about how people interact with each other. How do we create a culture that self-assesses and corrects over time? How do we ensure that the learned behaviours we pass on are those that we truly value?<p><br></p>I love helping people to discover new ways of thinking, learning and relearning. How can we improve the end to end delivery of value together? How do we embark on our own unique journey while embracing the vital elements of respect, focus and simplicity? I ask these questions constantly as we strive to build cohesive and collaborative teams: Magic is formed when people are encouraged to be creative, expressive and collectively responsible.<p><br></p>“Make no little plans: they have no magic to stir men’s blood.” - Daniel Burnham</p><br><p></p>",
